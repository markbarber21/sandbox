# General comments

Some of these things are "sections" and some are "pages". Pages contain sections (at least the front page does).

Pages have pictures and text. Some are like lists (news, portfolio, locations, FAQ). Some are informational (About Us, Our Mission, Contact Us).  It seems like we could probably generalize this concept and generate any number of pages. Of course, there needs to be a default setup as well -- give the customers some place to start.

Sections are like little pages. They can be lists (Links) or informational (Contact Information, Legal Stuff). Sections can also be links to other pages.

In general, a site will have some number of pages, which are all structurally similar, but have different labels and content.
